# Project: Playing Card Detection and Recognition

Private repo for Playing Card Detection and Recognition project for CS4337 Computer Vision

**Objective:** 

## 1. Introdution

This project was to create a computer vision model that was able to detect and identify playing cards (suits and ranks) within images. To achieve this, I used a pretrained YOLO model, yolov8, and ran it on a dataset I found on Roboflow using the A100 GPU on Google Colab for faster computation.

Once training was finished, I ran the model on validation and testing set images to verify how well the model performed on non-training images to make sure the model wasn't over or under fitted.

## 2. Setup and Workflow
